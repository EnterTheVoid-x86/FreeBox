# FreeBox

## What is FreeBox?

FreeBox is an alternative to GNU Coreutils and BusyBox made in the Rust programming language.
Featuring basic commands like ls, cat, yes, chmod, and more.

## What is the reason to build an alternative when everything already works?

The reason for building an alternative is to provide a GNU-free Linux system to everyone, because you are in control.

## Licensing

FreeBox has its own license, known as the FBFE OSS License (FreeBoxForEveryone).
